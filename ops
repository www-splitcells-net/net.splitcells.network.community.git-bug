Done via a repair hill climber.\n         * [x] retainedAllocatedHours is calculated incorrectly as it does not substract allocated hourse which are removed in the current optimization step.\n         * [x] There seems to be a problem in the understanding of index relations between allocations, free demands and used \ndemands. -\u003e This was documented.\n      * [x] Create history report more searchable by LibreOffice.\n        Otherwise, the low searchability will always take a toll during history analysis.\n      * [x] Improve hill climber repair performance by trying every supply value combination once instead of trying out all free supplies, which contains duplicates.\n   * [x] Assign teachers to courses.\n      * [x] Only grouping by course is important.\n      * [x] Determine not allocated courses and their not used demands.\n      * [ ] Determine defying groups and their not used and used demands.\n      * [ ] Determine a representative allocation of defying groups and undo all allocations of defying groups.\n      * [x] Use free demands of the representative for the repair of each defying group.\n      * [x] Randomize each repair step.\n      * [x] Select only suitable teachers.\n      * [x] Repair all incorrect values and not just some by repair any constraint error and by always converting all groupings to groupings by course id.\n      * [ ] Deallocate all lines with a course id, that has an error, during each repair iteration step.\n      * [ ] Optionally deallocate all lines with a subject, that has an error, during each repair iteration step.\n      * [ ] Use unused demands.\n      * [ ] Randomization performance seems to be bad.\n      * [ ] Defiance and rating calculation by Constraint seems to have very bad performance.\n      * [ ] When working on one sub problem, pause synchronization to other subscribed sub problems, in order to increase performance.\n      * [ ] Lazy synchronization between tables and lookup tables.\n      * [x] Improve raw lines and lines performance.\n      * [x]  Performance of nested lookup seems to be lacking.\n      * [ ] Improve `DatabaseI#distinctLines` performance.\n   * [ ] Assign students to courses.\n      * [ ] Ensure that all students are assigned to something, if there is something fitting. -\u003e Optionally Log if fitting supplies are not present for constraint group repair. The reason in this case why no fitting supply is present, is caused by the fact, that there is no feedback between the first sub problem and that last sub problem, regarding available rails of a subject.\n         * [x] How was the underlying solved in the second version of Gel? -\u003e If a sub problem cannot be solved, deallocate the corresponding allocations of the previous sub problem.\n         * [ ] Optimize solution dependencies, if solution cannot be optimized. Do this like in the second version of Gel, but in a generic way.\n            * [ ] Create constraint based network destructor between 2 directly interlinked solutions.\n            * [ ] Create escalation, so that indirectly linked solutions can be destructed as well.\n            * [ ] Create a generic solver, that combines constraint based repair with escalating destructor.\n      * [x] Free demands seemingly are ignored.\n      * [x] Only assign courses to the students demands, which fit their subject and vintage.\n      * [x] Is the following constraint correct? `r.forAll(RAIL).forAll(STUDENT).then(allSame(COURSE_ID));` -\u003e No, this was caused by misreading the previous version of the software.\n      * [x] Create cache for children rating. -\u003e Obsolete, because symptom was caused by too many calls of defying by group id.\n      * [x] Create performance test for defying by groupd id. -\u003e This was caused by too many calls of defying by group id.\n      * [x] Create cache for routing rating by group id. -\u003e This was caused by too many calls of defying by group id.\n      * [x] Make it easy to select constraint path during repair, via query interface.\n* [ ] Implement constraint query system for tables and use it in constraint based repair. Online optimization would be needed for that.\n* [x] Improve analysis by making it more table like and create guidelines for table (searchability and simplicity) versus tree (organization).\n* [ ] Adjust teacher subject suitability and course subject in test data. Some course subjects may need to have a teacher for the subject adjustments.\n* [ ] Test all constraints.\n* [ ] Ensure that test data more sane by manually checking these.\n* [x] Disable history by default, because otherwise is not a sane default performance setting.\n\n# Future Tasks\n* [ ] Fix last element of solution paths in logging (i.e. `net/splitcells/gel/GelEnv/demands.allocations.allocations/`).\n* [ ] Create a presentation for the problem.\n* [ ] Try out real profiling\n   * [ ] Document reasons: http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-most-sampling-java-profilers-are.html\n   * [ ] Via perfasm: http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2015/07/jmh-perfasm.html\n   * [ ] Consider Perf + perf-map-agent.","files":null}]}
